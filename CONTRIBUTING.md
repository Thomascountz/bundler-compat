# Contributing to bundler-compat

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for considering contributing to `bundler-compat`. I'm glad to have you here and would love to see how your ideas can make this gem even better. Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

No contribution is too small. If you have an idea, bug fix, question, or want to share your use cases, open an issue, or pull request. Sharing helps improve the gem for everyone.

### Opening an Issue

If you have an initial idea, question, bug report, or any other feedback, please open an issue. This is a great way to discuss ideas and get feedback before diving into code changes. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/bundler-compat/issues) page.
2. Click on the "New Issue" button.
3. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description of the issue. Screenshots, code snippets, and error messages are encouraged.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

PRs are welcome from anyone, whether you're a seasoned Ruby developer or just trying things out.

To submit a PR, you'll fork the repo, clone your fork, create a branch, make your changes, push them to your fork, and then open a PR against this upstream repository, (thomascountz/bundler-compat).

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Fork the Repository: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
2. Clone Your Fork:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/bundler-compat.git
    cd bundler-compat
    ```
3. Set Up Development Environment: Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
4. Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your changes.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```
5. Make Your Changes: Implement your changes in the new branch.
6. Run Tests: Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.
    ```sh
    rake test
    ```
7. Commit Your Changes: Write a clear commit message.
    ```sh
    git commit -am 'Add new feature'
    ```
8. Push to Your Fork:
    ```sh
    git push origin my-feature-branch
    ```
9. Open a Pull Request: Go back to the upstream repository (thomascountz/bundler-compat) and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes, then click "Create." Draft PRs are also welcome.

### Need Help?

If you have an idea but aren't sure where to start with implementing it, I'd be happy to help. Open an issue explaining your idea or problem, and we can collaborate to bring it to life. This could be something about the gem's functionality or even something specific to your project.

## What to Contribute

- New Features: Have an idea for improving bundler compatibility? Open an issue to discuss it or submit a PR.
- Bug Fixes: Found a bug? Open an issue or submit a PR with the fix.
- Documentation: Improvements to documentation are always welcome.
- Examples: If you want to share examples of how you're using the gem, please share them.
- Tests: Additional test coverage is always appreciated.

## Development Setup

After checking out the repo:

1. Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies
2. Run `rake test` to run the tests
3. Run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt to experiment

## Code of Conduct

I'm a software engineer today because of the awesome people I met and communities I was welcomed into on the internet. I think about how I can do the same for others, especially in internet spaces I help shape.

If something happens that makes you feel discouraged from participating in discussions or that your contributions are unwelcome, I want to see if I can help change that, so I hope you let me know.

On the flip side, if you do something that discourages someone else from participating or contributing, I'll reach out to you to see if we can fix it.

The thing I feel is important in internet spaces like this is that we all try to help others create, learn, and share.

## Thank You

Your contributions help make `bundler-compat` a more useful gem for the Ruby community.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
